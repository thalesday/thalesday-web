“I applaud your endeavor to establish Thales Day on the calendar at a time when language is used more often for propaganda than as a medium for the pursuit of truth. 

   Stories, ritual, and celebrations are a way of communicating knowing and of sharing a common culture just as the sacrament of touch communicates love in a different way than words. However, Mythos is a story that bounds our knowledge and is haunted by its temptation to believe it to be objective fact; this belief enables the powerful to control and exploit a neighbor. Logos knowledge is derived from the process of dialogue with Nature, with Mythos, and with Adversary. Dialogue has no bounds; it allows continued testing and modification of belief in our quest for the discovery of truth and of reconciliation with all people.

Yours Sincerely,

John B. Goodenough”
