[Trianglen Antikvariat](http://www.trianglenantikvariat.dk/) by Jens Sirich is an antiques shop in Copenhagen, Denmark that specializes in fiction and non-fiction books, as well as comic books, records, and videos. It is a unique oasis in the city where many different interests meet, sharing our passion for inclusive and insightful reflections. When we learned from world-renowned expert on happiness, Meik Wiking, who took part in a Thales Day panel, that book sharing can be a gateway to happiness Jens Sirich graciously agreed to donate books for guests at Thales Day to take home to read and deliver back the next year, or to swap for another.
